# w3plus.css
A fork of w3.css pro to make it even easier.

### Introduction
W3.css ([https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)) is a slim and fast responsive css framework that can perform many of the same functions as Bootstrap or Materialize, but without the extra javascript and bloat. It is easy to learn and remember.

The **w3plus.css** file is a fork of the current w3.css pro file with the following changes:

### Color Pallet Fix
**Before:** A full color pallet with many colors, such as "khaki" or "deep-purple."

**Now:** A modern color pallet with easy to remember color words, such as w3-light-blue or w3-dark-green.

### To Do List
* Hero Center Fix (Use large text in the center of your hero without breaking boundries)
* Responsive Text (Text resizes with your browser)
* Responsive Menu (without using a separate menu)
