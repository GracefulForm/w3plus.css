# w3plus.css
Extra hacks, fixes, and options to help make w3.css even easier.

### Introduction
W3.css ([https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)) is a slim and fast responsive css framework that can perform many of the same functions as Bootstrap or Materialize, but without the extra javascript and bloat. It is easy to learn and remember.

The **w3plus.css** file is a fork of the current w3.css file with all of these additions added.

### Color Pallet Fix
**Before:** A full color pallet with many colors, such as "khaki" or "deep-purple."

**Now:** This color pallet uses easy to remember syntax. 

**How to Use:** Just call the easy to remember color classes. The text and outline colors are not included, since they are rarely used. For those, you can add a quick header or inline style. More help here.
